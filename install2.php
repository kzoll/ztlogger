			<hr>The installation routine is straight foward and really painless.  We need to create the following files in the ZT Logger Vault: counter.dat, directory.inc, hook.txt, and ipwldb.csv.  The IP Address from which the ZT Logger installation routine (this file) is ran will automatically be whitelisted.  All pages being accessed from IP Address: <?php echo $ip ?> will not be logged by ZT Logger.<hr><br />
<?php
// Create counter.dat
if (!file_exists($ctr)){
	echo "Creating counter.dat in the Vault directory";
	$file = fopen($ctr,'a');
	$outputstring="0";
	fwrite($file,$outputstring);
	fclose($file);
	echo "<br />Setting chmod 0644 on counter.dat";
	chmod($ctr, 0644);
}

// Create directory.inc
if (!file_exists($dirinc)){
	echo "<br />Creating directory.inc in the Vault directory";
	$file = fopen($dirinc,'a');
	$length = 1;
	if (substr($directory,-$length) == "\\") {$outputstring='<?php global $path_to_ztlogger; $path_to_ztlogger="'.$directory.'\"; ?>';}
	if (substr($directory,-$length) != "\\") {$outputstring='<?php global $path_to_ztlogger; $path_to_ztlogger="'.$directory.'"; ?>';}
	fwrite($file,$outputstring);
	fclose($file);

// Create hook.txt
if (!file_exists($hook)){
	echo "<br />Creating hook.txt in the Vault directory";
	$file = fopen($hook,'a');
	$outputstring="<?php die(''); ?>\n\nYou must add the below code to all pages you wish to have logging enabled.  On most PHP based sites you can just add it to a single file that will be called by all pages.\n\n-----BEGIN PHP INCLUDE-----\ninclude('".$directory."ztlogger.php');\n-----END PHP INCLUDE-----";
	fwrite($file,$outputstring);
	fclose($file);
	echo "<br />Setting chmod 0644 on hook.txt";

echo "<h1>Done . . .</h1>Check the ZT Logger Vault for hook.txt.  You will need to add the include statement to the appropriate file of your CMS, Forum, or Blogging software, to start logging site activity.<br /><br />Make sure you delete install.php and install2.php from the ztlogger directory on your server.  The installer is intentionally designed to not overwrite counter.dat, directory.inc, hook.txt, and ipwldb.csv if they are already present.  However, do not take any chances and make sure you delete install.php and install2.php."
