----------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:
Unpack ztlogger.zip and copy the ztlogger folder and its entire contents to your server. Ensure that all folders are chmod 0755 and all files are chmod 0644. Run install.php from your web browser.  Click the Install button.


The following files are created in the ZT Logger Vault directory during install:
counter.dat
directory.inc
hook.txt
ipwldb.csv

The IP Address from which the ZT Logger installation routine is ran will automatically be whitelisted.  All pages being accessed from that IP Address will not be logged by ZT Logger.

Check the ZT Logger Vault for hook.txt.  You will need to add the include statement at the beginning of the appropriate file of your CMS, Forum, or Blogging software, to start logging site activity.

bbPress 1.x - bb-load.php
e107 - class2.php
Drupal - index.php
Flatpress - defaults.php
IPB  - index.php (root and admin)
Joomla - index.php (root and current template)
phpBB - common.php
SMF - settings.php
vBulletin - global.php
Wordpress - wp-load.php

Make sure you delete install.php and install2.php from the ztlogger directory on your server. The installer is intentionally designed to not overwrite counter.dat, directory.inc, hook.txt, and ipwldb.csv if they are already present.  However, do not take any chances and make sure you delete install.php and install2.php.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Upgrade:
Copy ztlogger/ztlogger.php > ztlogger/ztlogger.php
Copy ztogger/vault/GeoLiteCity.dat > ztogger/vault/GeoLiteCity.dat

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Whitelisting IPs:
To add an IP address to the whitelist, you will need to manually edit ipwldb.csv.  This is a comma-separated values (comma-delimited) file.  Meaning all values in the csv database are separated by a comma.  So, don't forget to add a space at the beginning and a comma at the end of each and every IP address you enter. Each and every entry must have a space before and a comma after each and every IP address.  I can't stress that enough.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Forthcoming:
Whitelisting form to alleviate the need to manually edit ipwldb.csv.  Whitelisting will be password protected.  The Whitelist password will be stored in ztlogger.ini.
