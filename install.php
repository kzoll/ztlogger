			<hr>The installation routine is straight foward and really painless.  We need to create the following files in the ZT Logger Vault: counter.dat, directory.inc, hook.txt, and ipwldb.csv.  The IP Address from which the ZT Logger installation routine (this file) is ran will automatically be whitelisted.  All pages being accessed from IP Address: <?php echo $ip ?> will not be logged by ZT Logger.<hr>
